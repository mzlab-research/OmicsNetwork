### 1.1 Stable Subnetwork Analysis for Specific Group - stable_subnetwork Function
Stable Subnetwork Analysis is a function that executes a complete stable subnetwork analysis pipeline, focusing on identifying and parsing highly connected stable network modules under a single experimental condition. This function implements end-to-end analysis from raw data to functional annotation.

  This function performs a complete stable subnetwork analysis pipeline for a specific experimental group (e.g., treatment group 'T'), including the following analyses:
  
  Data Preparation: Check column names, filter molecular quantitative values and sample table for the group (T) based on the group name.

* **Correlation Calculation:** Calculate inter-molecular associations using the specified correlation method (e.g., spearman). If there are more than 1000 molecules, select the top 1000 molecules by connectivity for subsequent analysis.

* **Network Stability Assessment:** Evaluate network connection stability through Bootstrap resampling, identifying network connections that stably exist across different resamplings.

* **Molecule Selection:** Filter important molecules based on correlation stability and significance indicators.

**Function Overview:**
  Network node enrichment analysis performs KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on nodes within a network, identifying biological pathways significantly enriched in the network. This function supports multi-omics data integration analysis, capable of simultaneously processing metabolomics data (KEGG IDs starting with C) and genomics/proteomics data (KEGG IDs starting with K), providing comprehensive pathway functional annotation.

**Main Parameter Description:**
  
  - annotation_table_select: Data frame or list containing feature annotations, must include a KEGG.ID column.
- species: Species abbreviation (e.g., "hsa" for human, "mmu" for mouse).
- nCores: Number of cores for parallel computation.
- omics_name: Omics type (e.g., c("proteomics","metabolomics")); typically used only in multi-omics analysis; when setting this parameter, the annotation data must include an omics_name column.
- group_name: Analysis group name, default "data".
- annotation_table_select: Data frame or list containing feature annotations, must include a KEGG.ID column.
- enrichment_p_threshold: Enrichment analysis p-value threshold, default 0.05.

**Analysis Features:**
  
  - Multi-omics Integration: Automatically identifies and integrates enrichment results from different omics types (metabolomics, genomics, etc.).
- Parallel Computing: Supports multi-core parallel processing to improve efficiency for large-scale data analysis.
- Automatic Database Management: Automatically downloads and manages KEGG database mapping files.
- Flexible Input: Supports two input formats: single network node list and subnetwork node list.

**Function Overview:**
  Differential overall network enrichment analysis is based on differential network analysis results, performing enrichment analysis on nodes corresponding to edges grouped by correlation state. This function can identify biological pathways significantly enriched under different correlation states (e.g., only in experimental group, only in control group, enhanced in experimental group, enhanced in control group, etc.), revealing the functional significance of network differences.

  ```R
data("differential_network_result")
Differential_network = differential_network_result@Differential_network

Enrichment <- run_diff_enrichment(
  Differential_network = Differential_network,
  species = 'hsa',
  enrichment_p_threshold = 0.05,
  compare_group = 'T:N'
)

# Visualization

#### 2.7.3 Differential Subnetwork Enrichment Analysis (Applicable to Multiplex Subnetworks) - run_diffsubnet_enrichment Function

**Function Overview:**
  Differential subnetwork enrichment analysis performs functional enrichment analysis on individual subnetworks within a differential network. This function can identify biological pathways significantly enriched for different correlation state groups (e.g., only in experimental group, only in control group, etc.) within each subnetwork, providing in-depth biological interpretation for understanding functional differences in network modules.

**Main Parameter Description:**
  
  - Differential_subnetwork: Differential subnetwork object, generated by the run_diff_network function.
- species: Species abbreviation (e.g., "hsa" for human, "mmu" for mouse).
